Adapting the exams would allow the university to be at the forefront of a national trend and thereby increase its reputation throughout the United States and the world.  Graduate students have complained that since they have to take comprehensive examinations, undergraduates should have to take them as well.  Moreover, by not administering the exams, a tradition dating back to the ancient Greeks is being violated.  Parents have written to administrators in favor of the exams.   Also, the exams would allow students to compare their performance with students at other schools.  Finally, job prospects might be improved.  Given these advantages of comprehensive exams, Penn State Abington should institute them immediately.</p>                    <p class="textcenter"><script type="text/javascript">writeButton("Continue");</script></p>        </td>      </tr>    </table>    </form>  </body></html>
