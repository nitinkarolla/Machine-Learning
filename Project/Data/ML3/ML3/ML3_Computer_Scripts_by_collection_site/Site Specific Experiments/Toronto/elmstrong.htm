Prestigious universities have comprehensive exams to maintain academic excellence. Universities who have instituted comprehensives have seen a reversal in the national trend toward declining standardized test scores. Moreover, graduate and professional schools show a clear preference for undergraduates who have passed a comprehensive exam.  Average starting salaries are higher for graduates of schools with comprehensive exams. Also, schools with the exams attract larger and more well-known corporations to recruit students for jobs.  Finally, the quality of undergraduate teaching has improved at schools with the exams.  Given these advantages of comprehensive exams, the University of Toronto should institute them immediately.</p>                    <p class="textcenter"><script type="text/javascript">writeButton("Continue");</script></p>        </td>      </tr>    </table>    </form>  </body></html>
