Last year was a particularly good one, and after you invested in increasing the output capacity of your plant, you decide that it would be very fruitful if you could find clients in other states to increase your business. Because you cannot spend too much time away from the plant, you decide to appoint someone to go around to prospective clients and negotiate contracts. This is a highly specialized market, and the job will mostly consist of going from one building site to another, establishing contacts with foremen and building contractors. It is also a highly competitive market, so bargaining may at some points be harsh. Finally, it's a very technical market, and a representative that did not exude confidence in their technical skills would not be taken seriously by potential clients. Realizing how useful such a help would be for you, you decide to give the person chosen one of the top-five salaries in your company. </p>           <table>              <tr>                <td width="80%" align="right">Do you feel that this job is better suited for one gender rather than the other?</td>                <td width="20%">                  <select name="mcdv1" class="ddtext">                    <option selected="selected" value=".">.</option>                    <option value="-3">yes, much better for women</option>                    <option value="-2">yes, better for women</option>                    <option value="-1">yes, slightly better for women</option>                    <option value="0">no, I do not feel this way at all</option>                    <option value="1">yes, slightly better for men</option>                    <option value="2">yes, better for men</option>                    <option value="3">yes, much better for men</option>                  </select>                 </td>              </tr>            </table> <br />                        <table>              <tr>                <td width="80%" align="right">In general, to what extent do you agree with the statement that women are just as able as men to do any kind of job?</td>                <td width="20%">                  <select name="mcdv2" class="ddtext">                    <option selected="selected" value=".">.</option>                    <option value="-3">disagree strongly</option>                    <option value="-2">disagree</option>                    <option value="-1">disagree slightly</option>                    <option value="0">neither agree nor disagree</option>                    <option value="1">agree slightly</option>                    <option value="2">agree</option>                    <option value="3">agree strongly</option>                  </select>                 </td>              </tr>            </table> <br />                    <p class="textcenter"><script type="text/javascript">writeButton("Continue");</script></p>        </td>      </tr>    </table>    </form>  </body></html>
